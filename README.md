👋 Hi, I’m Mark. (@MERingrose)

My goal is to build healthy, awesome software products for people to enhance their lives.

I'm currently riffing on React and enjoying that. I also like working in .NET Core and NodeJS. I have experience writing Java, C# and, to a lesser extent, C++ applications.

Send me a note at mark.e.ringrose@gmail.com.
